## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Zero-Trust Architecture
- All service-to-service communication via mTLS
- Identity-Aware Proxy for external access
- SPIFFE IDs for service identity
- 60-minute session timeout

### 2. Data Residency
- Primary regions: `us-east1` (US), `eu-west1` (EU)
- DR region: `us-west1`
- Phase 1-2: Single-region (us-east1)
- Phase 3+: Multi-region expansion

### 3. Compliance Framework
- GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2 compliance mapped
- Cryptographic erasure for right-to-be-forgotten
- 7-year retention for PII, 10-year for claims
- Immutable audit logs

### 4. AI Safety
- Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions
- Bias monitoring with demographic parity thresholds
- Model cards for all AI components
- EU AI Act alignment
